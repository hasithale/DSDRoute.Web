## User Experience Impact

### For Regular Users:
- ✅ **Simplified Menu**: Removed payment-related clutter from their workflow
- ✅ **Shop Access**: Direct access to shop management functionality  
- ✅ **Better Organization**: Clear separation between orders and shops
- ✅ **Permission Aligned**: Menu now matches their actual permissions (can view/add shops)

### For Admin Users:
- ✅ **No Change**: Admins still have access to all functionality including payments
- ✅ **Full Control**: Complete access to shops, payments, and all other features

The navigation now perfectly aligns with the User role permissions:
- Users can create orders ✅ → "My Orders" menu available
- Users can add/view shops ✅ → "Shops" menu available  
- Users cannot manage payments ❌ → "My Payments" menu removed

## Files Modified
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` - Updated navigation structure

The changes maintain the clean, intuitive navigation while ensuring users only see menu items relevant to their permissions! 🎉
